# data-archive-activity
This is where I will document and archive my analysis of past assignments for F18-Data Analysis Tools for Analytics.

The problem I analyzed for the assignments is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance hosted on Kaggle.

After loading the data, I had to transform the data to focus on the columns that I only needed to analyze and aggregate them to group the data. The data was then visualized to extract insights. The data analysis the distribution of monthly income for salespeople with and without attrition. It also visualizes the count of sales with attrition and salespeople without attrition.
